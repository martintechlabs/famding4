# FamDing - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Executive Summary

FamDing is a modern, private family communication platform that combines real-time messaging with intelligent memory preservation. Our core innovation is the seamless integration of family chat with a collaborative Memory Timeline - allowing families to communicate naturally while automatically preserving important moments in a beautiful, organized family history.

**Key Differentiators:**

- **One-tap Memory Flagging**: Transform any chat message into a permanent family memory
- **Unified Communication**: Chat, memories, and family coordination in one beautiful interface
- **Privacy-First**: Completely private family spaces with no external sharing
- **Multi-Generational Design**: Intuitive interface designed for all ages and tech comfort levels

## 2. Problem Statement

Geographically distributed families currently rely on general messaging apps like WhatsApp or Signal to stay connected, but these solutions have critical limitations:

- Important family moments, photos, and updates get buried in the constant stream of everyday chat messages
- There's no organized way to preserve and revisit meaningful family memories
- Family history becomes fragmented across multiple chat threads and platforms
- Older or less tech-savvy family members struggle to find important updates amid the noise

FamDing addresses these issues by providing a dedicated Family Memory Timeline that automatically organizes important family moments in a visual, easily accessible format.

## 4. Product Features

### 4.1 Killer Feature: Family Memory Timeline

The Family Memory Timeline is FamDing's core differentiator - a chronological, collaborative family memory timeline that automatically organizes important family moments in a visual, easily accessible format.

#### How It Works

1. **Simple Flagging System**: Any family member can flag a message, photo, or video as a "Family Memory" with a single tap
2. **Automatic Organization**: These memories appear on a dedicated, visual timeline separate from regular chats

4. **Searchable Archive**: Easily search memories by date, person, event type, or location
5. **Anniversary Reminders**: The app resurfaces meaningful memories on their anniversaries

#### Why It's Better Than WhatsApp/Signal

- **Preservation vs. Ephemeral**: Unlike chat apps where content disappears in the scroll, important moments are preserved
- **Organization vs. Chaos**: Structured timeline instead of chronological chat that mixes important updates with everyday conversation
- **Family-Focused Design**: Built specifically for preserving family history, not general communication
- **Collaborative Curation**: The entire family contributes to building a shared history
- **Generational Bridge**: Easily share family history with new members or younger generations

#### Implementation Focus
